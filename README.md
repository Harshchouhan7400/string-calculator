The StringCalculator class initializes with a number string, extracts and handles a custom delimiter if present, and sums the numbers, raising an error if negative numbers are included. The handle_custom_delimiter method determines the delimiter, modifies the string accordingly, and defaults to splitting by commas or newlines if no custom delimiter is specified.
